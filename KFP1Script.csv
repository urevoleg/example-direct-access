"Written here is the full transcript of DreamWorks Animation's full-length feature film, Kung Fu Panda. "

"[A mysterious warrior, with his identity hidden beneath a flowing robe and wide-brimmed hat, treks with his staff across a bridge above a huge lake.]"
"NARRATOR (PO): [In voiceover] Legend tells of a legendary warrior whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend. He traveled the land in search of worthy foes. "
""
"[The warrior approaches a large tavern towering in front of him. A gang of bandits harassing the rabbit staff inside are startled when the warrior enters abruptly, and stare silently as he passes them and sits at a table. As he eats, the gang surrounds him.]"
"GANG BOSS: I see you like to chew. Maybe you should chew ON MY FIST! [Slams fist onto table.] "
"NARRATOR (PO): The warrior said nothing for his mouth was full. [He holds up his paw.] Then he swallowed. [He swallows.] And then he spoke. "
"LEGENDARY WARRIOR: Enough talk. Let's fight! SHA-SHA-BOOEY! "
""
"[The warrior delivers a series of punches and kicks and the whole gang goes flying in various directions.]"
"NARRATOR (PO): He was so deadly in fact that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness! "
"NINJA CAT: [blindly flailing about] MY EYES! "
"GATOR: HE'S TOO AWESOME! "
"SMITTEN BUNNY: And attractive! "
"GRATEFUL BUNNY: How can we repay you? "
"LEGENDARY WARRIOR: There is no charge for awesomeness... or attractiveness. "
""
"[One hundred assassins appear and surround the warrior. The entire bar swells, packed to the rafters with ninjas.]"
"LEGENDARY WARRIOR: KABLOOEY! "
""
"[The roof explodes and the warrior with a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky. Like a tornado, the warrior twists and kicks them away rapidly.]"
"NARRATOR (PO): It mattered not how many foes he faced. They were no match for his bodacity. "
""
"[Two groups of thousands of foes leap at the warrior while in the air, but with a single flashy move he sends them flying. The beaten warriors plummet into the lake like rain as the warrior treks back across the bridge.]"
"NARRATOR (PO): Never before had a panda been so feared... and so loved. [He looks up towards the Jade Palace, where a group of five warriors stand in various poses.] Even the most heroic heroes in all of China, the Furious Five, bowed in respect to this great master. "
""
"[The Five leap down from the palace, land in front of the warrior, and bow respectfully, before flanking in positions on both sides of him.]"
"MONKEY: We should hang out. "
"LEGENDARY WARRIOR: Agreed. "
""
"[The Five strike an attack pose, as they face an army of thousands of bandits.]"
"NARRATOR (PO): But hanging out would have to wait. 'Cause when you're facing the ten thousand demons of Demon Mountain-- [He slices off the heads of the bandits' spears with a shiny green sword and leaps into battle with the Five.] ... there's only one thing that matters. And that's-- "
""
"[Freezing in mid-air, the Five talk to the warrior in a strange voice.]"
"MONKEY: Po! Get up! "
"TIGRESS: You'll be late for work! "
"PO: Whuh? "
""
"[The warrior suddenly falls, and Po lands hard on a wooden floor of his own room, revealing that the whole battle was actually a dream. He tries to clear his head and wake up.]"
"MR. PING: Po! Get up! "
""
"[Po looks around his room and see that it's filled with various kung fu posters (including a poster featuring all of the Five) and souvenirs, and a wooden version of the Sword of Heroes (the green sword). Po sighs and attempts to kick himself to his feet, but finds his belly too worthy a foe.]"
"MR. PING: Po! What are you doing up there? "
"PO: Uh, nothing! [He hops to his feet and faces his action figures.] Hi-ya! Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress! Grrraahh-- "
""
"[Outside on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig watering flowers stares at Po. Po tries to play it cool and then quickly ducks out of sight.]"
"MR. PING: Po! Let's go! You're late for work! "
"PO: Coming! "
""
"[He takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the wall. It bounces off. He throws the star again, but it bounces off again. He quickly picks it up and heads downstairs where he trips and falls the rest of the way. He falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor. A panda-shaped shadow looms over Po.]"
"PO: Sorry, Dad. "
"MR. PING: 'Sorry' doesn't make the noodles. "
""
"[Reveals that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being carried by a small goose. Po gets to work in the shop's small kitchen.]"
"MR. PING: What were you doing up there, all that noise? "
"PO: Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy dream. "
"MR. PING: About what? "
"PO: Huh? "
"MR. PING: What were you dreaming about? [He puts down the basket and begins chopping vegetables next to Po as he listens.] "
"PO: What was I... uh... I was dreaming about... [He sees Mr. Ping listening expectantly, and can't bring himself to say the truth. He glances down at the bowl he's holding.] Uh... noodles. "
"MR. PING: [He stops chopping vegetables.] Noodles? You were really dreaming about noodles? "
"PO: Uh, yeah. What else would I be dreaming about? "
""
"[Po hands a bowl of noodles to a customer, then realizes his throwing star is sitting in it.]"
"PO: [to customer] Oh, careful, that soup is... sharp! "
"MR. PING: Oh, happy day! My son, finally having the noodle dream! [He begins rummaging through something and arrives with an apron and a noodle hat. He ties the apron around Po's waist and places the noodle hat in Po's paws.] You don't know how long I have been waiting for this moment. This is a sign, Po! "
"PO: [He looks at the noodle hat nervously.] Uh... a sign of what? "
"MR. PING: You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my ""Secret Ingredient Soup"". And then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant! [He quickly runs over to section of wall with three portraits and points at them accordingly.] Just as I took it over from my father, who took it over from his father, who won it from a friend in a game of mahjong. "
"PO: Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream. [chuckles nervously] "
"MR. PING: No, it was the dream. We are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins. [While saying this, he hands two customers their bowls without even looking at them.] "
"PO: But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno, want to do something else? Something besides noodles? "
"MR. PING: Actually, when I was young and crazy, I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu. "
"PO: So why didn't you?! "
"MR. PING: Oh, because it was a stupid dream. Can you imagine me making tofu? [He laughs at the thought.] No. We all have our place in this world. Mine is here. And yours is-- "
"PO: I know. Is here. "
"MR. PING: No, it's at tables two, five, seven, and twelve. [He loads Po's arms with bowls of soup.] Service with a smile! "
""
"[A gong sounds in the distance. Po sighs and looks out the window at the distant Jade Palace."
""
"An old red panda is playing a flute. He is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle between the Training Hall. From behind the bushes, stealthy dark shapes move in the foreground. He is still playing and seems oblivious. Five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously, diving on him. He moves like lightning, the flute now wielded like a staff. He deflects, blocks, dodges, parries, and the attackers go flying. They roll and pick themselves up, turning to face him, who is now standing — poised — ready for their next move.]"
"SHIFU: Well done, students... if you were trying to disappoint me. "
""
"[He uses his flute to point at the Five, who respectfully bow as their name is mentioned.]"
"SHIFU: Tigress, you need more ferocity. Monkey, greater speed. Crane — height. Viper — subtlety. Mantis-- "
"ZENG: Master Shifu. "
""
"[Shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared palace goose.]"
"SHIFU: [impatiently] What?! "
"ZENG: [startled] Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you. "
""
"[Shifu looks up, concerned. He runs to the Jade Palace, which is lined with palace geese. The door bursts open. Shifu enters and comes to a halt. Candles and emerald lighting fill the room.  He takes a deep breath and bows.]"
"SHIFU: Master Oogway? You summoned me. [He looks up, still bowing.] Is something wrong? "
""
"[He looks up at a tortoise shell perfectly balanced on a thin wooden staff. Master Oogway, a wise and elderly tortoise, emerges slowly from his meditative position and climbs down effortlessly.]"
"OOGWAY: Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend? "
"SHIFU: So... nothing's wrong? "
"OOGWAY: Well, I didn't say that. "
""
"[Shifu looks up, concerned. Oogway opens his mouth... and blows out a candle. And another candle. And another. And another. Oogway opens his mouth to say something, then blows out another candle. Finally, an impatient Shifu uses his kung fu to blow them all out.]"
"SHIFU: You were saying? "
"OOGWAY: I have had a vision: Tai Lung will return. "
""
"[Shifu looks stricken. Quick, impressionistic images of a large, shadowy figure (Tai Lung) flash in his mind. Shifu is rattled.]"
"SHIFU: That is impossible! He is in prison! "
"OOGWAY: Nothing is impossible. "
"SHIFU: [He stares in horror for a second before reacting.] Zeng! "
""
"[Zeng comes flying in, and Shifu gets in his face.]"
"SHIFU: Fly to Chorh-Gom Prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons. Double everything! Tai Lung does not leave that prison! "
"ZENG: Yes, Master Shifu! "
""
"[The goose flies off, but then hits a column. Then he is off. Back on Oogway, as he walks away from Shifu.]"
"OOGWAY: [to himself] One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it. "
"SHIFU: [He rushes back to Oogway.] W-we have to do something. We can't just let him march on the Valley and take his revenge! He'll, he'll-- "
"OOGWAY: [He looks into the water of the Moon Pool.] Your mind is like this water, my friend. When it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see. But if you allow it to settle, the answer becomes clear. "
""
"[Shifu and Oogway stare into the pool. Oogway settles the water with his staff, revealing the reflection of an intricately-carved dragon clutching a scroll in its mouth.]"
"SHIFU: [He looks up.] The Dragon Scroll... "
"OOGWAY: [Looking up with Shifu.] It is time. "
"SHIFU: [Looks at Oogway.] But who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power? To become... the Dragon Warrior? "
"OOGWAY: [A short pause.] I don't know. [He smiles. Shifu stares at him.] "
""
"[Back at the noodle shop, Po is serving the customers at their tables. However, he struggles to squeeze through the small gaps. He accidentally knocks into a table.]"
"PIG CUSTOMER: Hey, watch it Po! "
"PO: Oh, sorry. Suck it up-- [sucks in stomach] "
""
"[His belly gets stuck between two tables, and in his attempt to lift himself free, Po accidentally sticks his tail puff into a rabbit family's soup bowl, making the rabbit children cry.]"
"PO: Oops, sorry! A thousand pardons... "
""
"[A gong sounds. Po turns, and sees a group of palace staff sticking a poster on the wall of the restaurant.]"
"PO: What?! [He runs over to the poster (which features the Furious Five), reads the writing, and gets very excited.] Master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior. Today! [Sets down noodle bowls.] Everyone! Everyone! Go, get to the Jade Palace! One of the Five is going to get the Dragon Scroll! "
""
"[He begins ushering out the customers. Mr. Ping looks up from the counter.]"
"PO: [Runs over to a customer trying to quickly finish their food.] We've been waiting a thousand years for this — just take the bowl! [Runs over to a rabbit counting coins.] This is the greatest day in kung fu history! Don't worry about it, just go! [He begins following the customers out of the restaurant until--] "
"MR. PING: Po! Where are you going? "
""
"[Po struggles to hide his dismay as he turns back to his father.]"
"PO: To the... Jade Palace?... [Inches slightly out of door.] "
"MR. PING: But you're forgetting your noodle cart! [He rolls a heavy-looking noodle cart towards Po.] The whole Valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them! "
"PO: Selling noodles? [Mr. Ping nods happily.] But Dad, I was kinda thinking maybe I-- "
"MR. PING: [smiling] Yeah? "
"PO: I was kinda thinking maybe I... "
"MR. PING: [still smiling] Uh-huh? "
"PO: ...could also sell the bean buns. They're-they're about to go bad. "
"MR. PING: That's my boy! I told you that dream was a sign! [He walks back into the shop.] "
"PO: [Looks down at the cart, disappointed.] Yeah, heh heh, glad I had it. "
""
"[At the Palace Arena just below the Jade Palace, palace staff are preparing for the tournament while children play and the villagers stream into the arena. The camera then moves outside the entrance doors and zooms down the thousand steps leading down to the village. It suddenly stops at the bottom where Po is staring open-mouthed at the daunting task ahead of him. He closes his mouth with a gulp, and begins to ascend the stairs, though is severely hindered by the noodle cart. Villagers move past him as he slowly makes progress. Some time later, Po is still ascending the stairs, dragging his cart behind him, exhausted. He stops for a breather and flops onto his back.]"
"PO: I'm... almost there... huh? [He sits up, and sees to his despair that he has only made it up seven steps.] No! Oh noooo! "
""
"[Two pig villagers, the Shaw brothers, pass by and meet Po on the stairs.]"
"K.G. SHAW: Sorry, Po. "
"J.R. SHAW: We'll bring you back a souvenir. "
""
"[They continue up the stairs. Po stares after them, and then makes a decision.]"
"PO: No... I'll bring me back a souvenir! [He casts away his apron and noodle hat, and makes his way up to the palace, leaving the noodle cart behind.] "
""
"[Up in the arena, Shifu is overseeing the preparations when Master Oogway appears, coming down the steps.]"
"SHIFU: It is an historic day — isn't it, Master Oogway? "
"OOGWAY: Yes, and one I feared I would not live to see. Are your students ready? "
"SHIFU: Yes, Master Oogway. "
"OOGWAY: Now know this, old friend. Whomever I choose will not only bring peace to the Valley, but also to you. "
""
"[Oogway walks off, leaving Shifu to ponder what this may mean. He quickly catches up with him as the crowd roars with excitement. A pig announcer approaches with a gong in his hoof.]"
"ANNOUNCER: Let the tournament begin! "
""
"[The pig strikes the gong as the crowd cheers. Outside the arena, Po finally reaches the top of the stairs; out of breath, but pleased with himself. His joy is cut short when he sees the entrance doors beginning to close.]"
"PO: Oh no! [He sprints for the doors.] No no no, wait... I'm coming! Yes! [The doors slam shut as he slams into them.] Owww... [Po collapses. The tournament music starts up. Po quickly gets back up and bangs in the door.] Hey, open the door! [Pigs rapping on drums drown out Po's banging.] Let me in! "
"SHIFU: [Inside the arena] Citizens of the Valley of Peace! [Po runs up to a small circular window, jumps and grabs it, and struggles to pull himself up and see inside.] It is my great honor to present to you... Tigress! Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five! "
""
"[Po laughs in delight as his idols leap onto the scene in a stunning display of kung fu prowess. Master Crane flaps his wings and sends a powerful gust of wind into the arena.]"
"PO: Oh, it's the Furious Five-- [He is cut short when the wind blows the window closed, knocking Po back onto the ground.] "
"SHIFU: Warriors prepare! "
"PO: Oh, ah! Peeky-hole! [Po spots a crack in the entrance doors and peeks through.] "
"SHIFU: Ready for battle! "
""
"[Po sees Master Crane getting into position, facing a deadly looking machine.]"
"PO: Yeah! Woo! The Thousand Tongues of Fire! [He laughs in anticipation.] "
"PIG FAN: Whoa, look at that! [Steps in front of and blocks Po's view.] "
"PO: Hey, get out of the way! "
""
"[Po hears a firing sound, looks up, and sees Crane being surrounded by fireworks. He keeps backing up so he can see the spectacle, but backs up too much and tumbles down the stairs again. By the time he gets back up, Crane has defeated the fireworks and disappeared from view. Po collapses on the ground in disappointment, but then gets back up with determination."
""
"While the crowd enjoys the tournament inside the arena, Po makes various attempts to gain access; first, he punches the doors, which causes him pain. Second, he attempts to pole-vault over the wall, but his weight bends the pole and he gets flung into the wall, cracking it. Third, he bends a tree to the ground and ties it with the plan to catapult himself into the arena. However, his weight keeps the tree bent when he cuts the rope. When he gets off, the tree springs up, whacking his nose, then springs back once to strike him on the head. In the next shot, Po is sitting at the top of the stairs, his back to the arena, apparently having given up.]"
"SHIFU: And finally... Master Tigress! "
""
"[Hearing this, Po once again gets up and starts looking for another plan. He sets out pulling back another, larger tree.]"
"SHIFU: Believe me citizens, you have not seen anything yet! "
"PO: I KNOW!!! "
"SHIFU: Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death! "
""
"[Inside the arena, Tigress prepares to face her daunting opponent. Po suddenly springs up above the arena, catapulted by the tree. Po gets a good glimpse of his favorite of the Five, but then bounces of the rooftops and crashes into a fireworks cart, just outside the arena."
""
"Back inside the arena, Oogway suddenly closes his eyes and raises his palm. The crowd hushes and looks up at him.]"
"OOGWAY: I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us. "
""
"[Shifu gives a nod to the Five. Monkey, Crane, Viper and Mantis join Tigress in the middle of the arena and they quickly position themselves into a line facing the older masters.]"
"SHIFU: Citizens of the Valley of Peace! Master Oogway will now choose... the Dragon Warrior! "
""
"[The crowd cheers, but Po is alarmed as he hears this.]"
"PO: Huh? Oh no! No no no, wait! [He suddenly sees the fireworks surrounding him and gets an idea.] Yeah... "
""
"[Inside the arena, the pigs are drumming as Oogway begins to slowly approach the Five, his palm swaying in the air as he prepares to make a decision. Outside, Po ties many small fireworks to a chair, sits on it, and lights the fuse.]"
"MR. PING: Po!? [He appears at the top of the stairs, holding Po's apron. He sees Po sitting on the fireworks chair.] What are you doing?! [He rushes forward and attempts to blow out the fuse.] "
"PO: What does it look like I'm doing?! No, stop, stop! I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior! "
""
"[Oogway is now closer to the Five.]"
"MR. PING: But I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream! "
""
"[This close to seeing the Dragon Warrior, Po is unable to maintain the façade any longer.]"
"PO: I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad! "
""
"[The goose's eyes widen. Po looks down and sees that the fuse is almost out. He braces himself and yells to the heavens.]"
"PO: I LOVE KUNG FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!... "
""
"[When Po opens his eyes, he finds himself still on the ground: the fuse was a dud. He loses balance on the little chair and falls flat on his face (the chair still stuck on his rear), then begins to sniffle, defeated at last. Though sympathetic, Mr. Ping holds out Po's apron.]"
"MR. PING: Oh, come on, son. Let's get back to work. "
"PO: [He sighs.] Okay. "
""
"[Po is sadly getting up when all of a sudden, the fireworks on the chair go off, propelling Po into the arena wall.]"
"MR. PING: Po! [Propelled by the fireworks, Po slides along the wall on his face, wailing.] Po, come back! "
""
"[Suddenly the chair changes direction and Po soars screaming into the sky directly above the arena in a display of fireworks. Below, the crowd looks up and ""Oooh"" and ""Aaah"" at the show. As Po eventually stops screaming and the fireworks die out, the burned chair disintegrates beneath him.]"
"PO: Uh oh. [He plummets back to earth and lands in the middle of the arena. Everything goes black upon impact.] "
""
"[After some inter-determinate time, Po groggily wakes up. Everything is blurry in his vision.]"
"PO: Ugh... [He looks up, and the first thing he sees is Masters Mantis and Viper staring down at him.] What's goin' on...? [He turns his head and sees Masters Monkey, Crane and Tigress, also staring at him.] Where, uh...? [What he sees next is a quivering finger pointing straight at his face.] What are you pointing...? "
""
"[He shakes his head, and his vision clears. He finds himself lying right in front of Oogway, the one pointing at him. He realizes with a jolt that he has landed right between the old master and the Furious Five.]"
"PO: Oh! Okay, sorry! I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was. "
"OOGWAY: How interesting. [He still points at Po, intrigued by this unexpected occurrence. Standing right behind Po, Tigress steps forward, confused.] "
"TIGRESS: Master, are you pointing at... me? "
"OOGWAY: Him. "
"PO: Who?... [Po attempts to move out of the way, but Oogway's finger follows him. Tigress's eyes widen.] "
"OOGWAY: You. "
"PO: Me? "
""
"[Oogway lifts up Po's arm with his staff for all to see.]"
"OOGWAY: The universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior! "
"PO: What? "
"FURIOUS FIVE: What?! "
"SHIFU: What!? "
"MR. PING: [Entering though the doors.] WHAT!? "
""
"[The announcer strikes the gong. Shifu snatches away the mallet, but is too late as the crowd cheers wildly and confetti rains down. Po stares around him, speechless. A group of palace geese rapidly descend the palace stairs with a palanquin.]"
"SHIFU: Stop! Wait! Who told you to- "
""
"[The geese move straight past him, down the remaining steps, and stop right in front of Po. Shifu races down after them as the panda is hoisted up on the palanquin. The geese struggle to lift the palanquin and make their way back towards the stairs. While the Five are bowed behind them, Shifu finally reaches Oogway.]"
"SHIFU: Master, Master wait! That flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to... our problem! You were about to point at Tigress and that thing fell in front of her! That was just an accident! "
"OOGWAY: There are no accidents. "
""
"[CRUNCH! Shifu, Oogway and the Five look up, startled. Po has broken through the palanquin and is now stuck in the newly-made hole. Shifu looks at Oogway, who simply smiles. Palace pigs surround Po and lift the palanquin with relative ease, and make their way up the stairs. Shifu stares after them in disbelief, as the Five slowly approach him.]"
"TIGRESS: Forgive us, Master. [She kneels forward and bows. The others follow suit.] We have failed you. "
""
"[Shifu holds up a paw to stop her.]"
"SHIFU: No. If the panda has not quit by morning, then I will have failed you. "
""
"[Around them, the crowd continues to cheers and the confetti rains down from the sky."
""
"Meanwhile, far away in the snowy mountains of Mongolia, Zeng the palace goose is approaching the fearsome Chor-Gom Prison. A rhino guard watches as Zeng flies past him, tired from the journey. With a cry, he crash lands on the ground outside the entrance doors, clutching a scroll. In an instant, two rhino guards thrust their spears in his face.]"
"ZENG: Wait, wait, wait wait! I bring a message! [The guards keep their spears pointed.] From Master Shifu! [The rhinos relax slightly. The enormous entrance doors are opened. Minutes later, Commander Vachir, the warden, is standing in front of the frightened Zeng, reading the scroll. What he reads enrages him.] "
"VACHIR: WHAT?! ""Double the guard? Extra precautions? Your prison may not be adequate?"" [He slams the scroll shut and glares down at the quaking Zeng. The guards behind the goose grip their weapons, equally outraged, and stare daggers at him.] You doubt my prison's security? "
"ZENG: Absolutely not. Shifu does. I'm just the messenger. [He gulps, intimidated.] "
"VACHIR: I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu. [He proceeds to lead Zeng along the bridge across from the doors.] Escape from Chorh-Gom Prison is impossible! "
""
"[Zeng looks in awe around the cavernous prison. He then looks over the side of the bridge into the dark and seemingly-bottomless abyss. Vachir suddenly slaps Zeng on the back, startling him and knocking a feather from his body, which floats down from the bridge.]"
"VACHIR: [Laughs.] Impressive, isn't it? "
"ZENG: [trembling] Oh yes, it's very impressive. It's very impressive! "
""
"[Vachir leads him deeper into the prison, while gloating about the security.]"
"VACHIR: One way in, one way out, one thousand guards, and one prisoner. "
"ZENG: Yes, except that prisoner is Tai Lung... "
""
"[The warden and the palace goose step into an elevator.]"
"VACHIR: [to guards] Take us down. "
""
"[The guards obey, and the elevator descends in the darkness towards the very bottom area of the prison. Vachir shakes the elevator to scare Zeng, and laughs at his frightened reaction. Eventually they reach the bottom. Zeng is led towards a set of heavily-armored doors, which open one after the other.]"
"ZENG: Oh my... "
""
"[The final door falls forward, creating a bridge towards a circular stone island in the middle of the abyss. In the middle of the island is a figure shrouded in darkness.]"
"VACHIR: Behold, Tai Lung. "
""
"[Zeng's eyes widen.]"
"ZENG: I'll, um... I'm just gonna wait right here. "
"VACHIR: [Laughs.] It's nothing to worry about. It's perfectly safe. [He pushes Zeng across the bridge, and follows after.] Crossbows! At the ready! "
"ZENG: Crossbows?! "
""
"[In sentry towers around the walls of the prison, guard train enormous crossbows on the figure on the island as Vachir and Zeng approach. Tai Lung, once a mighty kung fu warrior, is now weighed down with chains attached to enormous rocks hanging over the sides of the island, immobilized by a special stone tortoise shell on his back.]"
"VACHIR: Hey, tough guy! Did you hear? Oogway's finally going to give someone the Dragon Scroll and it's not going to be you! "
"ZENG: What are you doing? Don't get him mad! "
"VACHIR: What's he gonna do about it? I've got him completely immobilized. [He stamps on Tai Lung's tail, which crunches on impact. Zeng leaps back with a gasp, but Tai Lung makes no movement. Vachir laughs.] Awww, did I step on the witty kitty's tail? Awww... "
"ZENG: I'm good! I've seen enough! I'm gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing to worry about. "
"VACHIR: No he doesn't. [They walk back across the bridge.] "
"ZENG: Okay I'll tell him. Can we please go now?... "
""
"[Zeng and Vachir walk out of view. Meanwhile, Zeng's feather floats down and rests right in front of Tai Lung... and his eyes open. He whips out his tail and snatches the feather."
""
"[Back at the Jade Palace, the crowd continues to cheer for the Dragon Warrior as the palace pigs bring Po (still in the ruined palanquin) to the top of the palace stairs and inside the main building. They drop Po to the ground and quickly exit.]"
"PO: Wait a second! "
""
"[The doors close, leaving Po along in the room.]"
"PO: Hello? Uh... I think there's been a slight mistake. Everybody seems to think that I'm, uh... "
""
"[He slowly turns around and realizes where he is. He moans in pure amazement.]"
"PO: The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way! Look at this place! "
""
"[Po spots a rhino-suit of armor and runs up to it.]"
"PO: Master Flying Rhino's armor. With authentic battle damage! [He turns and sees another famous artifact — the green sword previously seen in Po's dream. He runs up to it.] Whoa... The Sword of Heroes! Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking-- OW! [He shakes his finger and sucks it. He then runs up to an apparently empty display.] The Invisible Trident of Destiny! [He looks up at a painting and gasps.] I've only seen paintings of that painting... "
""
"[Po joyfully examines other kung fu artifacts... and then spots an urn which appears to be glowing from the inside. He gasps.]"
"PO: [loudly] Nooo! Ohhhh! [He runs up to it.] The Legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors... said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu Army! [He hesitates before coming close to the urn and whispering into it.] Hello? "
"SHIFU: [From out of view] Have you finished sight-seeing? "
"PO: [gasp] Sorry! I should have come to see you first! "
"SHIFU: My patience is wearing thin. "
"PO: Oh. Well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere. "
"SHIFU: Do turn around. "
"PO: Sure. [He turns and sees Shifu.] Hey, how's it going? [Turns back to the urn.] Now how do you get get five hund-- Master Shifu! "
""
"[Startled, he accidentally knocks over the urn, and there is a ghostly wail as it shatters on the ground. Po, mortified, looks up at Shifu.]"
"PO: Someone... broke that. [Shifu stares at him in silence. Po attempts to pick up the pieces.] But I'm going to fix it. Do you have some glue?... [He knocks the urn's display table, and it topples on his head. Shifu continues to stare.] Ow! Ooh. Splinter. "
"SHIFU: So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior, hmm? "
"PO: Uh... I guess so? "
"SHIFU: Wrong! [Po stands up, alarmed.] You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll. [With his staff, he points up at the ceiling at the scroll.] "
"PO: Whoa... So how does this work? You have a ladder or trampoline or... "
""
"[Shifu chuckles coldly.]"
"SHIFU: You think it's that easy? That I'm just going to hand you the secret to limitless power? "
"PO: No, I- "
""
"[Shifu approaches Po.]"
"SHIFU: One must first master the highest level of kung fu. And that is clearly impossible if that one is someone like you. "
"PO: Someone like me? "
"SHIFU: Yes. Look at you! This fat butt. [He hits Po's butt with his staff, making Po cry out.] Flabby arms! [He hits Po's arm.] "
"PO: Ouch! Those are sensitive in the flabby parts. "
"SHIFU: And this ridiculous belly! [Jabs Po's stomach.] "
"PO: Hey... "
"SHIFU: And utter disregard for personal hygiene. "
"PO: Now wait a minute. That's a little uncalled for-- "
"SHIFU: Don't stand so close, I can smell your breath. "
"PO: [Points at Shifu.] Listen, Oogway said that I was the-- "
""
"[Suddenly, Shifu grabs Po's outstretched finger and lifts his pinky. Po gasps in horror.]"
"PO: The Wuxi Finger Hold! Not the Wuxi Finger Hold! "
"SHIFU: [slyly] Ohhh, you know this hold? "
"PO: [slurred together] Developed by Master Wuxi in the third dynasty. Yes! "
"SHIFU: Oh, then you must know what happens when I flex my pinky... "
"PO: [gasp] No no no! "
"SHIFU: You know the hardest part of this? The hardest part... is cleaning up afterwards. [chuckles] "
"PO: Okay! Okay, take it easy! "
"SHIFU: Now listen closely, panda. Oogway may have picked you, but when I'm through with you, I promise you: You're going to wish he hadn't! Are we clear? "
"PO: Yeah. We're clear! We're clear! We are so clear. "
"SHIFU: Good. [chuckles] I can't wait to get started. "
""
"[Shifu leads Po into the Training Hall, where the panda is struck speechless as he sees the Furious Five combating the various deadly stages of the course. Crane is deflecting arrows while balancing on half of a jade-colored turtle shell. Then Tigress leaps onto the shell and briefly spars with him. Meanwhile, Mantis weaves his way through an army of wooden crocodile warriors. Viper evades fire spurts on the Field of Fiery Death. Monkey swings across the seven-talon rings. Tigress dodges the swinging spiked clubs on spinning serpent logs, then smashes one with her bare fists. A piece of the club strikes Po on the head.]"
"SHIFU: Let's begin. "
"PO: Wait wait wait! What? [He stares at the fearsome course in front of him.] Now? "
"SHIFU: Yes, now. Unless you think that the great Oogway was wrong, and you are not the Dragon Warrior?... "
"PO: Oh, okay. Well... I don't know if I can do all of those moves... "
"SHIFU: Well, if we don't try, we'll never know, will we? [He begins walking along the side of the course. Po follows.] "
"PO: Uh, yeah. It's just-- maybe we can find something more suited to my level... "
"SHIFU: And what level is that? "
"PO: Well, ya know... I'm not a master, but uh, let's just start at zero. Level Zero. "
"SHIFU: [Laughs.] There is no such thing as Level Zero. "
"PO: Hey! Maybe I can start with that! "
""
"[Po points and runs over to a friendly-looking bandit dummy.]"
"SHIFU: That? We use that for training children. And for propping the door open when it's hot. But if you insist... "
""
"[At that moment, the Five gather around Po.]"
"PO: Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so much bigger than your action figures — except for you, Mantis. You're about the same. "
""
"[Mantis's antennae twitches as he glares. Po looks uncomfortable.]"
"SHIFU: Go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do. "
""
"[Po hesitates, seeing the Five watching him.]"
"PO: Um, are they going to watch. Or should I just wait until they get back to work or something?... "
"SHIFU: Hit it. "
"PO: [stalling] Okay. I mean I just ate, so I'm still digesting. So my kung fu might not be as good as later on... "
"SHIFU: Just hit it! "
"PO: [Pauses.] Alright... [He turns to the dummy.] Whatcha got? You got nothin' 'cause I got it right here. You picking on my friends? [He begins dancing on the spot.] Get ready to feel the thunder. I'm comin' at him with the crazy feet. Whatcha gonna do about my crazy feet? I'm a blur. I'm a blur. You never seen bear style, you only seen praying Mantis! OR... I could come at you Monkey style. [Makes monkey sounds. Monkey raises his eyebrows.] OR... I'm comin' at ya snikity-snake... "
""
"[Shifu and the Five stare at Po as he faces the dummy, and Shifu loses his patience.]"
"SHIFU: Would you hit it!? "
""
"[Po stops dancing.]"
"PO: Alright... Alright. "
""
"[Hesitantly, he very light hits the dummy with his fist. It rocks back into place.]"
"SHIFU: Why don't you try again? A little harder. "
""
"[This time, Po knocks the dummy all the way backwards.]"
"PO: How's tha-- "
""
"[WHACK! The dummy rights itself and whacks Po, sending him flying backwards and knocking out a tooth. Po finds himself in the training course. The Five instinctively step forward to help Po, but Shifu holds up his paw to stop them."
""
"Po struggles to balance on the serpent logs, and eventually ends up doing a painful split on two of them.]"
"PO: Ow! Oh, that hurts! "
""
"[He looks up and sees a spiky tethered ball, which hits and sends Po flying into the jade turtle exercise, where it rattles him around. The Five wince while Shifu looks on with a smile.]"
"SHIFU: [to the Five] This'll be easier than I thought. "
"PO: Feeling a little nauseous... "
""
"[The turtle spills him out and he stumbles into the army of wooden warriors, proceed to whack every part of his body.]"
"PO: Ow, those are hard! Ooh! I think I-- [The last dummy whaps him in the crotch and everything become still.] Oooohoohoo... my tenders. "
""
"[He struggles to get on his feet, takes one step and reaches out to a dummy arm...and immediately gets pummeled all over again. Po comes out the other side battered and bruised and finds he is standing on the Field of Fiery Death.]"
"PO: Uh oh. "
""
"[We see reflections of fire on the Five and Shifu as well as Po's yells as he gets singed. After a while, he comes crawling into frame, dazed and charred, with the little tuft on his head on fire.]"
"PO: [gasping for breath] How did I do? "
"SHIFU: There is now a Level Zero. [He puts out the little fire with his fingers.] "
""
"[That night, the Five are walking to the bunkhouse, which sits high on a hill, led by a palace goose with a lantern.]"
"MANTIS: There's no words. "
"CRANE: No denying that. "
"VIPER: I don't understand what Master Oogway was thinking. The poor guy's just going to get himself killed! "
"CRANE: [mocking] He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior... fell out of the sky on a ball of fire! "
"MANTIS: When he walks, the very ground shakes! "
""
"[Everyone laughs except Tigress.]"
"TIGRESS: One would think that Master Oogway would choose someone who actually knew kung fu. [She walks ahead.] "
"CRANE: Yeah, or could at least touch his toes. "
"MONKEY: Or even see his toes. "
""
"[As the others walk off, laughing, Po emerges from behind rock, who unbeknownst to them has been walking behind them this whole time, hearing everything. He attempts to look at his toes, but just sees gut. He lifts up his stomach, leans forward... leans... leans... and falls over. He gets up and watches them go inside. He sighs."
""
"Inside, the Five blow out the candles in their rooms as Po peeks around the corner.]"
"PO: Okay. "
""
"[He tip-toes into the hall. SQUEAK. The floorboards strain beneath him. SQUEAK.]"
"PO: [whispering] Great. "
""
"[Po takes a gentle step. Cre-e-e-a-aa--CHUNK! Po's foot goes through the floor. Po tries to recover. SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK! THUNK! Po rolls his ankle and stumbles through a bedroom door. He turns and finds Crane staring back at him.]"
"PO: Oh hey... hi. You're up. "
"CRANE: Am now. "
"PO: I was just, uh... Some day, huh? That kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Your biceps sore? "
""
"[Crane looks at his wing.]"
"CRANE: Um... I've had a long and rather disappointing day, so uh...yeah, I should probably get to sleep now. "
"PO:Yeah yeah yeah, of course. [Turns to leave.] "
"CRANE: [Relieved] Okay, thanks. "
"PO: It's just... I'm such a big fan. [Turns back.] "
"CRANE: [Alarmed] Oop. "
"PO: You guys were totally amazing at the Battle of Weeping River. Outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop, and then you just... WA-YA-HA-HA HI-YAH! "
""
"[Po does a spastic series of kung fu moves and... RIP... kicks his foot through the paper wall.]"
"PO: Ooh, sorry about that. [Looks through the hole to see Monkey glaring at him.] "
"CRANE: Look, you don't belong here. "
""
"[Po looks stung to be hearing this from one of his heroes.]"
"PO: I know. I know. You're right. I just-- my whole life, I've dreamed of-- "
""
"[Crane stops Po before he embarrasses himself even more.]"
"CRANE: No no no... I meant you don't belong here. I mean, in this room. This is my room. Property of Crane. "
""
"[Po is mortified, but covers.]"
"PO: Oh, okay. Right right. Yeah, you want to get to sleep. [Begins backing out of the room.] "
"CRANE: Yeah. "
"PO: I'm keepin' you up. We got big things tomorrow. [Begins shutting the door.] Alright. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Okay. Bye bye. "
""
"[Po shuts the door. His silhouette can be seen standing outside, not moving. Crane sighs. The door suddenly opens. Po pokes his head in with an eager smile.]"
"PO: What was that? "
"CRANE: I didn't say anything. "
"PO: Okay. Alright. Goodnight. Sleep well. "
""
"[Po backs out and closes the door. Crane puts his foot on his head.]"
"PO: Seemed a little bit awkward... "
""
"[Po turns and walks down the hall to find a vacant room. CREAK-CREAK... Tigress opens the door next to him. Po winces.]"
"PO: Master Tigress! Didn't mean to wake you. I was just, uh-- "
"TIGRESS: You don't belong here. "
"PO: Uh, yeah, of course. This is your room-- [Tigress approaches and glares at him.] "
"TIGRESS: I mean... you don't belong in the Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to kung fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning. "
""
"[She closes the door on Po, who stares, stunned and saddened.]"
"PO: Big fan... "
""
"[A little later, a dejected Po is standing under a peach tree on a hill. Oogway approaches with a glowing lantern.]"
"OOGWAY: I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom. "
""
"[Po spins around, his arms full of peaches and his mouth equally stuffed. He drops the peaches in shock.]"
"PO: [with his mouth full] Is that what this is? I am so sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree. "
"OOGWAY: I understand. You eat when you are upset. "
"PO: [Spits out the remaining peaches and slurs words together.] Upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset? "
"OOGWAY: So why are you upset? "
""
"[Po pauses, then sighs: There's no use trying to lie to Oogway.]"
"PO: I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu, in the history of China, in the history of sucking. "
"OOGWAY: Probably. "
"PO: And the Five... man, you should have seen them, they totally hate me. "
"OOGWAY: Totally. "
"PO: How's Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior? [He lifts his belly and drops it, causing it to bounce until he stops with his his paw. He sighs.] I mean, I'm not like the Five. I've got no claws, no wings, no venom. Even Mantis has those... [imitating a mantis's front legs] ...thingies. Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles. "
""
"[Po sits down, his back to Oogway. Oogway look at him for a moment.]"
"OOGWAY: Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't noodles. [Po looks back at him, confused.] You are too concerned with what was and what will be. There's a saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present. "
""
"[Oogway hits the tree with his staff as he walks away, and a peach falls into Po's open paw. Po smiles as he watches the tortoise leave."
""
"VACHIR: OH NO! "
"ZENG: What's happening?! "
"VACHIR: Fire Crossbows! "
"ZENG: Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu! "
"VACHIR: You're not going anywhere, and neither is he!  "
"ZENG: Let go of me!  "
"VACHIR: [To guards] Bring it up! "
"RHINO GUARD #1: Wait! Bring it back! "
"ZENG: He's coming this way! "
"VACHIR: He won't get far. [To guards] Archers! "
"ZENG: We're dead. So very, very dead. "
"VACHIR: [Laughs] Not yet we're not! Now! "
"ZENG: Can we run now?  "
"VACHIR: [Sobs in terror.] Yes. "
"ZENG: URRRK! "
"TAI LUNG: I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was beginning to think I had been forgotten. [With a creepy tenderness, Tai Lung smooths the goose's ruffled feathers. Then he learns closer to Zeng.] Fly back there and tell them... the real Dragon Warrior is coming home. "
"FURIOUS FIVE: Good morning master! "
"SHIFU: Panda! [No answer] Panda, wake up! "
"SHIFU: [Satisfied] He's quit. "
"[Shifu walks with a bit more energy as he and the Five approach the training hall courtyard. Tigress looks equally pleased.] "
"VIPER: What do we do now, Master? With the panda gone, who will be the Dragon Warrior? "
"SHIFU: All we can do is resume our training and trust that in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed. "
"SHIFU: What are you doing here?! "
"PO: Hey! Huh... Good morning, Master! I just thought I'd warm up a little. [He tries to lift one leg, but fails.] "
"SHIFU: You're stuck. "
"PO: Stuck?! Whaa? Pfft... stuck... does this look stuck to you... Yeah, I'm stuck. "
"SHIFU: [To Crane] Help him. "
"CRANE: Oh dear. "
"PO: Maybe on three. One. Two- "
"PO: [Gets to his feet.] Thank you. "
"CRANE: Don't mention it. "
"PO: No really, I appreci-- "
"CRANE: Ever. "
"SHIFU: You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night? It takes years to develop one's flexibility... [Shifu flings two boards into the air, and Tigress steps forwards.] and years longer to apply it in combat. "
"SHIFU: Put that down! The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones. "
"PO: Yeah, excellent! [He chucks away the chunk.] "
"SHIFU: Let's get started. "
"VIPER: Are you ready? "
"PO: I was born ready-- "
"PO: OW! Oh... "
"VIPER: I'm sorry, brother! I thought you said you were ready! "
"PO: That was awesome! Let's go again. [salutes]  "
"SHIFU: I've been taking it easy on you, panda, but no more! Your next opponent... will be me. "
"PO: Alright! Yeah, let's go! "
"SHIFU: Step forth. "
"SHIFU: The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness and make him suffer for it. "
"PO: [In pain, but delighted .] Oh ho, yeah!  "
"SHIFU: To take his strength and use it against him. [Shifu kicks Po repeatedly in the face. He throw him to the floor again, and grips Po by the nose.] Until he finally falls, or quits. "
"PO: [Nasally] But a real warrior never quits. Don't worry, Master, I will never quit! "
"TIGRESS: If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps. "
"MONKEY: But he will. "
"[Tigress walks back inside.] "
"VIPER: He's not gonna quit, is he? "
"MANTIS: He's not gonna quit bouncin', I'll tell ya that. "
"PO: Aaaoo...whoohoo...EEEee...hee- hee... OW! I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel [Mantis pops us from behind Po holding a handful of needes and sticks him again.] better! "
"MANTIS: Trust me, it will. It's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this... "
"PO: Fat? "
"MANTIS: Fur, I was going to say fur. [Removes the needle and moves to another part of Po's back.] "
"PO: [Skeptical] Sure you were. "
"MANTIS: [Adjusts a needle and taps Po's back for nerves.] Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? I mean... look at me. "
"MANTIS: I'm over here. "
"PO: Ah-HAH! "
"VIPER: Maybe you should take a look at this again. "
"MANTIS: [looks at the diagram] Oh! Okay. "
"PO: Ow! Don't... [laughing] "
"PO: Stop it, stop... YOW! "
"PO: I know Master Shifu's trying to inspire me and all, but if I didn't know any better... I'd say he was trying to get rid of me. "
"MANTIS: I know he can seem kind of heartless... "
"PO: Ah! "
"MANTIS: But, you know, he wasn't always like that. "
"VIPER: According to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile. "
"PO: No... "
"VIPER: But that was before... [She hesitates] "
"PO: Before what? "
"TIGRESS: Before Tai Lung. "
"CRANE: Uh yeah, we're not really supposed to talk about him. "
"TIGRESS: Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know. "
"PO: Guys, guys. I know about Tai Lung. "
"[Tigress looks at Po.] "
"PO: He was a student, the first ever to master the thousand......scrolls of... kung fu... [Tigress gives him a piercing stare. He nervously trails off.] and... then he turned bad... and... now he's in jail... "
"TIGRESS: He wasn't just a student. "
"TIGRESS (V.O.): Shifu found him as a cub. And he raised him as his son. "
"TIGRESS (V.O.): ...and when the boy showed talent in kung fu... [A slightly older Tai Lung approaches the training dummy. He kicks it across the floor, and it hits the wall, knocking a spear from the weapons rack. Shifu approaches, impressed, and Tai Lung nudges him affectionately.] "
"TIGRESS (V.O.): ...Shifu trained him. [Shifu teaches Tai Lung how to punch.] He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness. "
"TIGRESS (V.O.): It was never enough for Tai Lung. "
"TIGRESS (V.O.): He wanted the Dragon Scroll. But Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused. "
"TIGRESS (V.O.): Outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley. "
"TIGRESS (V.O.): He tried to take the scroll by force. And Shifu had to destroy what he had created. "
"TIGRESS (V.O.): But how could he? "
"TIGRESS (V.O.): Shifu loved Tai Lung like he'd never loved anyone before... "
"TIGRESS (V.O.): ...or since. "
"TIGRESS: And now he has a chance to make things right, to train the true Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with you... a big, fat panda who treats it like a joke. "
"PO: Doieeeee... "
"TIGRESS: [At that, Tigress loses her temper and raises her fist.] Oh, that's it! "
"MANTIS: Wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve. "
"MANTIS: And may have also stopped his heart. "
"[In the Training Hall, Shifu is sitting in meditation, surrounded by candles. His inner turmoil causes him to fidget incessantly.] "
"SHIFU: Inner peace... inner peace... i-in... in-in...inner peace. "
"SHIFU: Would whoever is making that flapping sound, quiet down! "
"SHIFU: Inner... "
"SHIFU: Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use some good news right now. "
"ZENG: Uh... "
"SHIFU: Master! Master! "
"OOGWAY: Hmmm? "
"SHIFU: [out of breath] I have... it's... it's very bad news. "
"OOGWAY: Ah, Shifu. There is just news. There is no good or bad. "
"SHIFU: Master, your vision...your vision was right! Tai Lung has broken out of prison! He's on his way! "
"OOGWAY: That is bad news... if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him. "
"SHIFU: The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior. He wasn't even meant to be here... it was an accident! "
"OOGWAY: There are no accidents. "
"SHIFU: [Sighs.] Yes, I know. You've said that already. Twice. "
"OOGWAY: Well, that was no accident either. "
"SHIFU: [Holds up three fingers.] Thrice. "
"OOGWAY: My old friend, the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours, until you let go of the illusion of control. "
"SHIFU: Illusion? "
"OOGWAY: Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu. [Oogway looks up at the tree's branches, where blossom petals continue to fall.] I cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time. "
"SHIFU: But there are things we can control! "
"SHIFU: I can control when the fruit will fall! "
"SHIFU: And I can control... "
"SHIFU: ... where to plant the seed... hi-yah! "
"SHIFU: That is no illusion, Master! "
"OOGWAY: Ah, yes. [Oogway steps forwards while Shifu begins pacing in frustration.] But no matter what you do, that seed will grow to be a peach tree. You may wish for an apple, or an orange... but you will get a peach. "
"SHIFU: [Stops pacing and turns to Oogway.] But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung! "
"OOGWAY: Maybe it can. If you are willing to guide it, to nurture it. To believe in it. "
"SHIFU: But how? How? I need your help, Master. "
"OOGWAY: No, you just need to believe. [He leans in towards his friend.] Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you will believe. "
"SHIFU: I... I will try. "
"OOGWAY: Good. "
"OOGWAY: My time has come. "
"OOGWAY: You must continue your journey... without me. "
"SHIFU: What... what, wait... what are you..? "
"SHIFU: Master! You can't leave me! "
"OOGWAY: You must... believe. "
"SHIFU: Master! "
"PO (O.S.): ...So I'm like, fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province... "
"PO: ...but you're a lousy tipper. "
"CRANE: [Incredulous] Really? So... how'd you get out of there alive? "
"PO: [Falters] I mean, I didn't actually say that, but I thought it... in... in my mind. "
"PO: [Covering] If he... could read my mind, he'd have been like, ""What?"" [then] Order up! "
"PO: Hope you like it. "
"MANTIS: [Takes a sip.] This is really good! "
"PO: [Bashful] No, c'mon. You should try my dad's secret ingredient soup. He actually... knows the secret ingredient. "
"VIPER: What are you talking about? This is amazing. "
"CRANE: Wow, you're a really good cook. "
"MANTIS: I wish my mouth was bigger. "
"MONKEY: Tigress, you've got to try this. "
"TIGRESS: It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months at a time on nothing but the dew of a single gingko leaf and the energy of the universe. "
"PO: I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna need a lot more than dew. And, uh, universe juice. "
"PO: What? "
"MANTIS: Oh, nothing... Master Shifu! "
"PO: [Imitating Shifu] You will never be the Dragon Warrior, unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush your teeth! "
"PO: What is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it! Work hard, Panda. And maybe, someday... [He picks up two empty bowls and holds them up like ears.] ... you will have ears like mine! "
"PO: [Normal] Ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good. "
"MONKEY: It's Shifu. "
"PO: Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing? "
"PO: Ooh! Master Shifu! I... "
"SHIFU: You think this is funny?! Tai Lung has escaped from prison and you're acting like children! "
"PO: What? "
"SHIFU: He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him! "
"PO: And here I am saying you got no sense of humor. I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung... "
"PO: What, you're serious? And I have to... uh... Master Oogway will stop him! He did it before, he'll do it again. "
"SHIFU: [Snaps] Oogway cannot! [He softens as he looks down at Oogway's staff.] Not anymore. "
"SHIFU: Our only hope... is the Dragon Warrior. "
"TIGRESS: The panda? "
"SHIFU: Yes, the panda! "
"TIGRESS: Master, please! Let us stop Tai Lung, this is what you've trained us for! "
"SHIFU: No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung. It is his!  "
"SHIFU: Where'd he go? "
"SHIFU: You cannot leave! A real warrior never quits! "
"PO: Watch me! "
"PO: Oh come on! How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs. "
"SHIFU: You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior! "
"PO: Ow! You don't believe that! [Shifu hits him again.] Ow! You never believed that! From the first moment I got here, you've been trying to get rid of me! "
"SHIFU: Yes! I was! But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine. "
"PO: You're not my master. [He shoves the staff away.] And I'm not the Dragon Warrior. "
"SHIFU: Then why didn't you quit?! You knew I was trying to get rid of you, and yet you stayed! "
"PO: Yeah, I stayed. "
"PO: I stayed because though every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled, it hurt... [Shifu stares at him.] but it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me. "
"PO: I stayed because I thought if anyone could change me... could make me... not me, it was you! The greatest kung fu teacher in all of China! "
"SHIFU: But I can change you! I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will! "
"PO: Oh come on! Tai Lung is on his way here right now! And even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you... gonna change this... [indicates belly] ...into the Dragon Warrior?! Huh? "
"PO: How... how? "
"PO: HOW?! "
"SHIFU: I DON'T KNOW! "
"SHIFU: I don't know. "
"PO: That's what I thought. "
"TIGRESS: This is what you trained me for. "
"VIPER: Tigress! "
"TIGRESS: Don't try and stop me! "
"VIPER: We're not trying to stop you! "
"TIGRESS: What? "
"VIPER: We're coming with you! "
"VOICE: [Faintly in the distance.] Yah! Hai! "
"PO: Hai...yah! Wai-ya!  "
"PO: [Annoyed and with his mouth full.] What? I eat when I'm upset, okay? "
"SHIFU: Oh, no need to explain. I just thought you might be Monkey... he hides his almond cookies on the top shelf. "
"PO: [Mouth full] Don't tell Monkey. "
"SHIFU: Look at you... "
"PO: Yeah, I know. I disgust you. "
"SHIFU: No no, I mean... how did you get up there? "
"PO: I don't know. I guess I-- I don't know. I was getting a cookie... "
"SHIFU: And yet you are ten feet off the ground... and have done a perfect split. "
"PO: No, this... this is just an... [Po's eyes widen as he begins to slip.] accident. "
"SHIFU: There are no accidents. Come with me. "
"PO: [Panting] I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fu-ey... but could you at least tell me where we're going? "
"PO: [Panting] You... dragged me... all the way out here... for a bath?! "
"SHIFU: Panda, we do not wash our pits in The Pool of Sacred Tears. "
"PO: [In awe] The pool of... "
"SHIFU: This is where Oogway unravelled the mysteries of harmony and focus. This is the birthplace... of kung fu. "
"SHIFU: Do you want to learn kung fu? "
"PO: [Awestruck] Yeah... "
"SHIFU: Then I am... your... master! "
"PO: Okay! "
"SHIFU: Don't cry. "
"PO: [Sniffs] Okay. "
"[Shifu and Po face each other an open field of green grass.] "
"SHIFU: When you focus on kung fu... when you concentrate...you stink. "
"SHIFU: But perhaps that is my fault. [Po looks up] I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five. I now see that the way to get through to you... is with this. "
"PO: Oh great, `cause I am hungry. "
"SHIFU: Good. When you have been trained, you may eat. "
"SHIFU: Let us begin. "
"SHIFU: After you, panda. "
"PO: That's it? No situps? N-no... no ten mile hikes? "
"SHIFU: I vowed to train you... and you have been trained. You are free to eat. "
"SHIFU: Enjoy. "
"PO: Hey!  "
"SHIFU: I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling. "
"PO: Hey! "
"SHIFU: You are free... to eat! "
"PO: Am I?! "
"SHIFU: Are you?! "
"PO: I'm not hungry. "
"PO: Master. [He salutes.] "
"TIGRESS: Cut it! "
"TAI LUNG: Where's the Dragon Warrior? "
"TIGRESS: How do you know you're not looking at her? "
"TAI LUNG: You think I'm a fool? I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you! "
"TAI LUNG: I heard how he fell out of the sky on a ball of fire... that he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen. "
"MONKEY: Po?! "
"TAI LUNG: So that is his name... Po. Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary! "
"MONKEY: We've got this. Help her! [Crane and Viper hand over their ropes.] "
"VIPER: [Choked] Monkey! "
"MANTIS: Go! "
"MANTIS: Ack! What was I thinking?! "
"TIGRESS: Mantis! "
"TIGRESS: Now! "
"TAI LUNG: Shifu taught you well... "
"TAI LUNG: But he didn't teach you everything. "
"SHIFU: You have done well, Panda. "
"PO: Done well? Done well?! I've done awesome! "
"SHIFU: The mark of a true hero is humility. But yes...you have done... "
"SHIFU: ...awesome. "
"PO: Huh? "
"PO: Guys? Guys! "
"PO: They're dead?! No, they're breathing! They're asleep?! No, their eyes are open...  "
"CRANE: [Out of breath] We were no match... for his nerve attack. "
"SHIFU: He has gotten stronger... "
"PO: Who? Tai Lung? Stronger? "
"MONKEY: He's too fast! [He slowly realizes where he is.] Sorry, Po. "
"TIGRESS: [Ashamed] I thought we could stop him... "
"SHIFU: He could have killed you. "
"MANTIS: Why didn't he?  "
"SHIFU: Most likely so you could come back here and strike fear in our hearts. But it won't work! "
"PO: Uh, it might... I mean, a little. I'm pretty scared. "
"SHIFU: You can defeat him, panda! "
"PO: Are you kidding? If they can't... [Around him, the Five are exhausted and beaten.] They're five masters. I'm just one me. "
"SHIFU: But you will have the one thing that no one else does. "
"PO: You really... believe I'm ready? "
"SHIFU: You are... Po.  "
"SHIFU: Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is yours. "
"PO: Wait... what happens when I read it? "
"SHIFU: No one knows, but legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing-beat. "
"PO: Whoa! Really? That's cool. "
"SHIFU: Yes. And see light in the deepest cave. You will feel the universe in motion around you. "
"PO: [Gets overexcited.] Wow! Can I punch through walls? Can I do a quadruple back flip? Will I have invisibility-- "
"SHIFU: Focus... focus. "
"PO: Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah. "
"SHIFU: Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny. Read it and become... the Dragon Warrior! "
"PO: Whooaa!!! "
"PO: It's impossible to open. "
"PO: Come on baby. Come on now... "
"PO: Thank you. I probably loosened it up for you though... Okay, here goes. "
"PO: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! "
"PO: It's blank! "
"SHIFU: What!? "
"PO: Here! Look!  "
"SHIFU: No! I am forbidden to look upon... "
"SHIFU: Blank? I don't...I don't understand. "
"PO: Okay. So like, Oogway... was just a crazy old turtle after all? "
"SHIFU: No. Oogway was wiser than us all. "
"PO: Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me by accident. Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding? "
"TIGRESS: But who will stop Tai Lung? "
"CRANE: He'll destroy everything... and everyone. "
"SHIFU: No. "
"SHIFU: Evacuate the Valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage. "
"TIGRESS: What about you master? "
"SHIFU: I will fight him. "
"PO: What? "
"SHIFU: I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape. "
"PO: But Shifu... he'll kill you. "
"SHIFU: Then I will finally have paid for my mistake. "
"SHIFU: Listen to me, all of you. It is time for you to continue your journey without me. I am very proud to have been your master. "
"TIGRESS: We've got to get them out safely. "
"MONKEY: Come, little one. Let's find your mama. [Leaps away.] "
"TIGRESS: Viper, gather the southern farmers. Mantis, the north. Crane, light the way. "
"JR SHAW: [Skeptically] Look, it's the Dragon Warrior. "
"PO: Hey, Dad. "
"MR. PING: Po! "
"MR. PING: Good to have you back, son! "
"PO: [Listlessly] Good to be back. "
"MR. PING: Let's go, Po. "
"MR. PING: So for our next shop, it's time to face it... the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables, no longer slices. "
"MR. PING: Also, I was thinking, maybe this time we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in. Hmm? You like that? "
"MR. PING: Er, Po... I'm sorry things didn't work out. It just... wasn't meant to be. "
"MR. PING: Po, forget everything else. Your destiny still awaits. We are noodle folk... broth runs deep through our veins! "
"PO: I don't know, Dad. Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son. "
"MR. PING: Po, I think it's time I told you something I should have told you a long time ago... "
"PO: [Looks up] Okay... "
"MR. PING: The secret ingredient of my secret ingredient soup! "
"PO: Oh. "
"MR. PING: C'mere! The secret ingredient is... nothing! "
"PO: Huh? "
"MR. PING: You heard me. Nothing. There is no secret ingredient! "
"PO: Wait wait wait...it's just plain old noodle soup? You don't add some kind of special sauce or something? "
"MR. PING: Don't have to. To make something special, you just have to believe it's special. "
"PO: There is no secret ingredient... "
"TAI LUNG: I have come home... Master. "
"SHIFU: This is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master. "
"TAI LUNG: Yes. You have a new favorite. So where is this... Po? [Chuckles] Did I scare him off? "
"SHIFU: This battle is between you and me. "
"TAI LUNG: So... [Tai Lung turns his back on Shifu.] That is how it's going to be? "
"SHIFU: That is how it must be. [Puts himself in a kung fu position.] "
"TAI LUNG: I rotted in jail for twenty years because of your weakness! "
"SHIFU: Obeying your master is not weakness! "
"TAI LUNG: You knew I was the Dragon Warrior! You always knew... "
"[Dissolve to FLASHBACK. In the Hall of Warriors, Shifu presents Tai Lung to Master Oogway. Both a slightly younger Tai Lung and Shifu look expectant. Oogway gives Shifu a look. Shifu is dismayed.] "
"TAI LUNG: But, when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do? What did you do?! "
"TAI LUNG: NOTHING! "
"SHIFU: You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault! "
"TAI LUNG: [Points at Shifu] NOT YOUR FAULT?! "
"TAI LUNG: WHO FILLED MY HEAD WITH DREAMS?! WHO DROVE ME TO TRAIN UNTIL MY BONES CRACKED?! WHO DENIED ME MY DESTINY?! "
"SHIFU: It was never my decision to make! "
"TAI LUNG: It is now. "
"TAI LUNG: Give... me... the scroll! "
"SHIFU: I would rather die! "
"TAI LUNG: All I ever did, I did to make you proud! Tell me how proud you are, Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME! "
"SHIFU: [Weakly] I... have always been proud of you. From the first moment, I've been... proud of you. "
"SHIFU: And it was my pride... that blinded me. I loved you too much to see what you were becoming. What I... was turning you into... I'm... I'm sorry. "
"TAI LUNG: I don't want your apology... I want my scroll! "
"TAI LUNG: What? WHERE IS IT?! "
"SHIFU: [Strangled] Dragon Warrior has taken scroll halfway across China by... now. [Coughs] You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung. [Tai Lung unsheathes his claws.] Never! N-never... "
"PO (O.S.): Hey! "
"PO: [Out of breath] Huff... huff... huff... Stairs... huff... "
"TAI LUNG: Who are you? "
"PO: Buddy... I... am the Dragon Warrior! [Exhales hard] Huhhh... "
"TAI LUNG: You?! Him?! [To Shifu, who he casts aside.] He's a panda. [Back to Po] You're a panda. What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me? "
"PO: Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna use this! "
"[Po holds out the Dragon Scroll.] "
"PO: You want it? Come and get it. "
"TAI LUNG: Finally... AH! "
"PO: [Slow-mo] Oh... WOW! "
"TAI LUNG: That scroll is mine! "
"PO: Lightning! Whoo! "
"PO: Ahhh! "
"PO: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHA!!! "
"TAI LUNG: The scroll has given him power! NOOOOOOOO! "
"TAI LUNG: Finally... oh yes... the power of the Dragon Scroll... is... MINE! "
"TAI LUNG: It's NOTHING!! "
"PO: It's okay. I didn't get it the first time either. "
"TAI LUNG: [Disbelief] What? "
"PO: There is no secret ingredient. "
"PO: It's just you. "
"TAI LUNG: RRRAAAH! "
"PO: AAAAGGGHH! "
"PO: Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee! Don't! Don't! "
"TAI LUNG: [Heavy breathing] You... can't defeat me... you... you're just a big... fat... panda! "
"PO: I'm not a big, fat panda... I'm THE big, fat panda! "
"TAI LUNG: The Wuxi Finger Hold! "
"PO: Oh, you know this hold? "
"TAI LUNG: You're bluffing... you're bluffing! Shifu didn't teach you that! "
"PO: Nope. [Tai Lung looks hopeful.] I figured it out. [Tai Lung's eyes widen.] "
"PO: Skadoosh! "
"KG SHAW: Look! The Dragon Warrior. "
"MR. PING: That's my boy! That big, lovely kung fu warrior is my son! "
"PO: Thanks, Dad. "
"PO: Hey, guys. "
"TIGRESS: Master. "
"ALL: Master. "
"PO: [Modest, but secretly pleased.] Master? [Then, remembering...] Master Shifu! "
"PO: Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay? "
"SHIFU: [weakly opens eyes] Po... you're alive... [darkly] Or we're both dead. "
"PO: No, Master, I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung! "
"SHIFU: [Astonished] You did? "
"SHIFU: Wow... It is as Oogway... foretold. You are... the Dragon Warrior. You have brought peace... to this Valley... and... and to me. Thank you... thank you, Po... thank you... thank you... thank... "
"PO: No... Master! No, no, no! Don't die, Shifu, please... "
"SHIFU: I'm not dying, you idio... ah... Dragon Warrior. [Shifu closes his eyes and smiles serenely.] I'm simply... at peace. Finally.. "
"PO: [Relieved.] Oh... So, um, I should... stop talking? "
"SHIFU: If you can. "
"PO: You want to get something to eat? "
"[Shifu opens his eyes and sighs deeply. For a long moment he says nothing. And then...]"
"SHIFU: Yeah. "
